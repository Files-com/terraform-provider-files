# files_automation_run (Data Source)

An AutomationRun is a record with information about a single execution of a given Automation.



Automation Runs can be retried upon `failure` or `partial_failure` by setting the `retry_on_failure_interval_in_minutes` and `retry_on_failure_number_of_attempts` settings on the associated Automation.



When retries occur, a new AutomationRun will be created for each retry. The property `retry_at` on the original run, if set, represents when that run will be retried next. The properties `retried_at` and `retried_in_run_id` will be set in the original run that failed, at the time of retry. The property `retry_of_run_id` will be set in the new run.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "files_automation_run" "example_automation_run" {
  id = 1
}
```
