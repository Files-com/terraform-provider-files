  The Action Notification Export API provides access to outgoing webhook logs. Querying webhook logs is a little different than other APIs.
  All queries against the archive must be submitted as Exports. (Even our Web UI creates an Export behind the scenes.)
  In any query field in this API, you may specify multiple values separated by commas. That means that commas
  cannot be searched for themselves, and neither can single quotation marks.
  Use the following steps to complete an export:
  
  Initiate the export by using the Create Action Notification Export endpoint. Non Site Admins must query by folder or path.
  Using the id from the response to step 1, poll the Show Action Notification Export endpoint. Check the status field until it is ready.
  You can download the results of the export as a CSV file using the results_url field in the response from step 2. If you want to page through the records in JSON format, use the List Action Notification Export Results endpoint, passing the id that you got in step 1 as the action_notification_export_id parameter. Check the X-Files-Cursor-Next header to see if there are more records available, and resubmit the same request with a cursor parameter to fetch the next page of results. Unlike most API Endpoints, this endpoint does not provide X-Files-Cursor-Prev cursors allowing reverse pagination through the results. This is due to limitations in Amazon Athena, the underlying data lake for these records.
  If you intend to use this API for high volume or automated use, please contact us with more information
  about your use case.
  Example Queries
  
  History for a folder: { "query_folder": "path/to/folder" }
  History for a range of time: { "start_at": "2021-03-18 12:00:00", "end_at": "2021-03-19 12:00:00" }
  History of all notifications that used GET or POST: { "query_request_method": "GET,POST" }

# files_action_notification_export (Data Source)

The Action Notification Export API provides access to outgoing webhook logs. Querying webhook logs is a little different than other APIs.



All queries against the archive must be submitted as Exports. (Even our Web UI creates an Export behind the scenes.)



In any query field in this API, you may specify multiple values separated by commas. That means that commas

cannot be searched for themselves, and neither can single quotation marks.



Use the following steps to complete an export:



1. Initiate the export by using the Create Action Notification Export endpoint. Non Site Admins must query by folder or path.

2. Using the `id` from the response to step 1, poll the Show Action Notification Export endpoint. Check the `status` field until it is `ready`.

3. You can download the results of the export as a CSV file using the `results_url` field in the response from step 2. If you want to page through the records in JSON format, use the List Action Notification Export Results endpoint, passing the `id` that you got in step 1 as the `action_notification_export_id` parameter. Check the `X-Files-Cursor-Next` header to see if there are more records available, and resubmit the same request with a `cursor` parameter to fetch the next page of results. Unlike most API Endpoints, this endpoint does not provide `X-Files-Cursor-Prev` cursors allowing reverse pagination through the results. This is due to limitations in Amazon Athena, the underlying data lake for these records.



If you intend to use this API for high volume or automated use, please contact us with more information

about your use case.



## Example Queries



* History for a folder: `{ "query_folder": "path/to/folder" }`

* History for a range of time: `{ "start_at": "2021-03-18 12:00:00", "end_at": "2021-03-19 12:00:00" }`

* History of all notifications that used GET or POST: `{ "query_request_method": "GET,POST" }`

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "files_action_notification_export" "example_action_notification_export" {
  id = 1
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (Number) History Export ID

### Read-Only

- `end_at` (String) End date/time of export range.
- `export_version` (String) Version of the underlying records for the export.
- `query_folder` (String) Return notifications that were triggered by actions in this folder.
- `query_message` (String) Error message associated with the request, if any.
- `query_path` (String) Return notifications that were triggered by actions on this specific path.
- `query_request_method` (String) The HTTP request method used by the webhook.
- `query_request_url` (String) The target webhook URL.
- `query_status` (String) The HTTP status returned from the server in response to the webhook request.
- `query_success` (Boolean) true if the webhook request succeeded (i.e. returned a 200 or 204 response status). false otherwise.
- `results_url` (String) If `status` is `ready`, this will be a URL where all the results can be downloaded at once as a CSV.
- `start_at` (String) Start date/time of export range.
- `status` (String) Status of export.  Valid values: `building`, `ready`, or `failed`
