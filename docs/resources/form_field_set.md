# files_form_field_set (Resource)

A Form Field Set is a custom form to be used for bundle and inbox registrations.



Each Form Field Set contains one or more Form Fields. A form and all of its form fields are submitted in a single create request. The order of form fields in the array is the order they will be displayed.



Once created, a form field set can then be associated with one or more bundle(s) and/or inbox(s). Once associated, you will be required to submit well-formatted form-data when creating a bundle-registration or inbox registration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "files_form_field_set" "example_form_field_set" {
  user_id      = 1
  title        = "Sample Form Title"
  skip_email   = false
  skip_name    = false
  skip_company = false
  form_fields  = [
    {
      label              = "Sample Label"
      required           = true
      help_text          = "Help Text"
      field_type         = "text"
      options_for_select = ["red", "green", "blue"]
      default_option     = "red"
