# files_workspace (Resource)

A Workspace is a lightweight way to organize related resources inside a single Files.com Site.



Customers commonly group resources by project, department, client, or region. Workspaces provide a built-in structure for that grouping, so the UI can operate within a clear “workspace context” and admins can delegate management for a subset of resources without requiring full site-level isolation.



Every Site has an implicit Default workspace (ID 0). Resources that are not explicitly assigned to a named workspace are considered part of the Default workspace.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "files_workspace" "example_workspace" {
  name = "Project Alpha"
}
```
