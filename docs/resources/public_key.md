# files_public_key (Resource)

A PublicKey is used to authenticate to Files.com via SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol). This method of authentication allows users to use their private key (which is never shared with Files.com) to authenticate themselves against the PublicKey stored on Files.com.



When a user configures their PublicKey, it allows them to bypass traditional password-based authentication, leveraging the security of key-based authentication instead.



Note that Files.com's SSH support is limited to file operations only. While users can securely transfer files and manage their data via SFTP, they do not have access to a full shell environment for executing arbitrary commands.



When generating new SSH keys, here are the available options: Files.com supports multiple SSH key algorithms: RSA (default 4096 bits, range 1024-4096 in 8-bit increments), DSA (1024 bits only), Ed25519 (256 bits), and ECDSA (256, 384, or 521 bits). When generating keys, the system uses these default lengths unless a specific length is specified.



Files.com also supports importing additional key types that cannot be generated: security key types (sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, sk-ssh-ed25519). RSA keys up to 8192 bits are also supported for import.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "files_public_key" "example_public_key" {
  user_id                       = 1
  title                         = "My Main Key"
  public_key                    = "example"
  generate_keypair              = false
  generate_private_key_password = "[your private key password]"
  generate_algorithm            = "rsa"
  generate_length               = 4096
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `title` (String) Public key title

### Optional

- `generate_algorithm` (String) Type of key to generate.  One of rsa, dsa, ecdsa, ed25519. Used for the generation of the key. Will be ignored if `generate_keypair` is false.
- `generate_keypair` (Boolean) If true, generate a new SSH key pair. Can not be used with `public_key`
- `generate_length` (Number) Length of key to generate. If algorithm is ecdsa, this is the signature size. Used for the generation of the key. Will be ignored if `generate_keypair` is false.
- `generate_private_key_password` (String) Password for the private key. Used for the generation of the key. Will be ignored if `generate_keypair` is false.
- `public_key` (String) Only returned when generating keys. Public key generated for the user.
- `user_id` (Number) User ID this public key is associated with

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Public key created at date/time
- `fingerprint` (String) Public key fingerprint (MD5)
- `fingerprint_sha256` (String) Public key fingerprint (SHA256)
- `id` (Number) Public key ID
- `last_login_at` (String) Key's most recent login time via SFTP
- `private_key` (String) Only returned when generating keys. Private key generated for the user.
- `status` (String) Only returned when generating keys. Can be invalid, not_generated, generating, complete
- `username` (String) Username of the user this public key is associated with

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Public Keys can be imported by specifying the id.
terraform import files_public_key.example_public_key 1
```
