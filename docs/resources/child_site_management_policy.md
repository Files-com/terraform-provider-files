# files_child_site_management_policy (Resource)

A Child Site Management Policy is a centralized policy defined by a parent site to enforce consistent configurations across child sites. These policies allow parent sites to maintain control over specific aspects of their child sites' functionality and appearance.



Policies can be applied to all child sites, or specific sites can be exempted from policy management by adding their site ID to the `skip_child_site_ids` parameter.



The `value` field contains the policy configuration data, with the format varying based on the policy type. When a policy is active, its managed configurations are automatically enforced on applicable child sites, and attribute modifications are not permitted.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "files_child_site_management_policy" "example_child_site_management_policy" {
  value               = {
    color2_left = "#000000"
  }
  skip_child_site_ids = [1, 2]
  policy_type         = "settings"
  name                = "example"
  description         = "example"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `policy_type` (String) Type of policy.  Valid values: `settings`.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Description for this policy.
- `name` (String) Name for this policy.
- `skip_child_site_ids` (List of Number) IDs of child sites that this policy has been exempted from. If `skip_child_site_ids` is empty, the policy will be applied to all child sites. To apply a policy to a child site that has been exempted, remove it from `skip_child_site_ids` or set it to an empty array (`[]`).
- `value` (Dynamic) Policy configuration data. Attributes differ by policy type. For more information, refer to the Value Hash section of the developer documentation.

### Read-Only

- `applied_child_site_ids` (List of Number) IDs of child sites that this policy has been applied to. This field is read-only.
- `created_at` (String) When this policy was created.
- `id` (Number) Policy ID.
- `updated_at` (String) When this policy was last updated.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Child Site Management Policies can be imported by specifying the id.
terraform import files_child_site_management_policy.example_child_site_management_policy 1
```
