  mdn_validation_level    = "none"
  server_certificate      = "require_match"
  default_mime_type       = "application/octet-stream"
  additional_http_headers = {
    key = "example value"

## Schema

### Required

- `as2_station_id` (Number) ID of the AS2 Station associated with this partner.
- `name` (String) The partner's formal AS2 name.
- `public_certificate` (String) Public certificate for AS2 Partner.  Note: This is the certificate for AS2 message security, not a certificate used for HTTPS authentication.
- `uri` (String) Public URI where we will send the AS2 messages (via HTTP/HTTPS).

### Optional

- `additional_http_headers` (Dynamic) Additional HTTP Headers for outgoing message sent to this partner.
- `default_mime_type` (String) Default mime type of the file attached to the encrypted message
- `enable_dedicated_ips` (Boolean) If `true`, we will use your site's dedicated IPs for all outbound connections to this AS2 Partner.
- `http_auth_password` (String) Password to send to server for HTTP Authentication.
- `http_auth_username` (String) Username to send to server for HTTP Authentication.
- `mdn_validation_level` (String) How should Files.com evaluate message transfer success based on a partner's MDN response?  This setting does not affect MDN storage; all MDNs received from a partner are always stored. `none`: MDN is stored for informational purposes only, a successful HTTPS transfer is a successful AS2 transfer. `weak`: Inspect the MDN for MIC and Disposition only. `normal`: `weak` plus validate MDN signature matches body, `strict`: `normal` but do not allow signatures from self-signed or incorrectly purposed certificates.
- `server_certificate` (String) Should we require that the remote HTTP server have a valid SSL Certificate for HTTPS? (This only applies to Outgoing AS2 message from Files.com to a Partner.)
