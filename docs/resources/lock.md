# files_lock (Resource)

A Lock can be used by your custom-developed applications to implement file locking and concurrency features. These locks are advisory, meaning that while a lock can be created, it does not prevent other API requests from being processed concurrently. You are responsible for checking locks prior to accessing a file.

Files.com's WebDAV offering and desktop app leverage this locking API to manage concurrent file operations, ensuring consistency when multiple users or systems interact with the same files. It is not used within the Files.com web interface.

## Example Usage

  exclusive                = false
  recursive                = true
  timeout                  = 1
