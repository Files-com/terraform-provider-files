- `protocol_access_groups_only` (Boolean) If true, protocol access permissions on users will be ignored, and only protocol access permissions set on Groups will be honored.  Make sure that your current user is a member of a group with API permission when changing this value to avoid locking yourself out of your site.

- `sftp_insecure_diffie_hellman` (Boolean) If true, we will allow weak Diffie Hellman parameters to be used within ciphers for SFTP that are otherwise on our secure list.  This has the effect of making the cipher weaker than our normal threshold for security, but is required to support certain legacy or broken SSH and MFT clients.  Enabling this weakens security, but not nearly as much as enabling the full `sftp_insecure_ciphers` option.

Contrary to its name, this setting does not disable TLS (it used to do that a long time ago), but rather enables certain ciphers which are known to be insecure but required for broad MFT compatibility.
