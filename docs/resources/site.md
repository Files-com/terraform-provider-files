- `pin_all_remote_servers_to_site_region` (Boolean) If true, we will ensure that all internal communications with any remote server are made through the primary region of the site. This setting overrides individual remote server settings.
- `prevent_root_permissions_for_non_site_admins` (Boolean) If true, we will prevent non-administrators from receiving any permissions directly on the root folder.  This is commonly used to prevent the accidental application of permissions.
- `protocol_access_groups_only` (Boolean) If true, protocol access permissions on users will be ignored, and only protocol access permissions set on Groups will be honored.  Make sure that your current user is a member of a group with API permission when changing this value to avoid locking yourself out of your site.
- `reply_to_email` (String) Reply-to email for this site
- `require_2fa` (Boolean) Require two-factor authentication for all users?

- `sftp_insecure_ciphers` (Boolean) If true, we will allow weak and known insecure ciphers to be used for SFTP connections.  Enabling this setting severely weakens the security of your site and it is not recommend, except as a last resort for compatibility.
- `sftp_insecure_diffie_hellman` (Boolean) If true, we will allow weak Diffie Hellman parameters to be used within ciphers for SFTP that are otherwise on our secure list.  This has the effect of making the cipher weaker than our normal threshold for security, but is required to support certain legacy or broken SSH and MFT clients.  Enabling this weakens security, but not nearly as much as enabling the full `sftp_insecure_ciphers` option.
